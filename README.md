SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS USING TWITTER DATA

From the retrieved data I have created a word cloud and sentiment plot.

Word clouds allow you to display words or responses as a text graphic with the most common value written in the largest text.

Sentiment plot allows you to display the sentiment score from the text data.

By looking at the insights from the twitter data we can say that there are more people who support demonetization, moreover there are people who oppose the same.

We can also identify the feelings of people by looking at Bar graph of Sentiments image.
